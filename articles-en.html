      <div class="article-content">
        <h2>Climate Change</h2>
        <p>According to the IPCC 2023 report, human activities have led to global warming, polar ice melting, rising sea levels, and intensified natural disasters. The report warns that unless greenhouse gas emissions are halved by 2030, limiting warming to 1.5°C will be impossible.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Over 3.6 billion people live in vulnerable regions</li>
          <li>Droughts, floods, wildfires, and storms are intensifying</li>
          <li>Solutions include clean energy, reduced fossil fuel use, and ecosystem restoration</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="article-content">
        <h2>Recycling and Waste Management</h2>
        <p>The UNEP 2024 report shows that the world generates over 2 billion tons of waste annually, with only 20% properly recycled. Continuing this trend will severely pollute soil, water, and air. A shift to circular economy could recycle up to 70% of waste.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Waste management costs may reach $4 trillion by 2030</li>
          <li>Recycling plastics, paper, metals, and organics is essential</li>
          <li>Public education and urban infrastructure are key</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="article-content">
        <h2>Renewable Energy</h2>
        <p>IRENA’s 2023 report emphasizes that to meet the 1.5°C goal, renewable energy capacity must triple by 2030. Solar, wind, and hydro can supply up to 90% of global energy needs while drastically reducing carbon emissions.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Clean energy boosts jobs and reduces health costs</li>
          <li>Countries must phase out fossil fuel subsidies</li>
          <li>Investment in storage and smart grids is critical</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="article-content">
        <h2>Climate and Health</h2>
        <p>According to WHO, climate change causes 250,000 additional deaths annually due to malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea, and heat stress. Poorer regions with weak infrastructure suffer the most. Air pollution is a major cause of heart and respiratory diseases.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Health must be central to climate policies</li>
            <li>Health systems need climate resilience</li>
            <li>Education and early warning systems are vital</li>

          <h2>Environmental Education</h2>
          <p>UNESCO identifies environmental education as key to sustainable development. It includes cognitive, social-emotional, and behavioral skills that help students make informed decisions and take action to protect the planet.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Education should start at an early age</li>
            <li>Schools should implement hands-on projects like tree planting</li>
            <li>Environmental education must be part of formal curricula</li>
